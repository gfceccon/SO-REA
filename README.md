# Disk Formatting - Open Educational Resource

This informative application was developed as an Open Educational Resource (OER), within the discipline of Operational Systems I. Its intent is to show how a disk is organized, and also all the techniques used in low-level formatting and high-level formatting to improve the performance of the disk.

### How to Use

This application was developed with ease of use in our minds. When first entering it, you can see a lateral menu, which contains all the available sections of the application, as well as the language selection flags.

The first button is "Begin", which will simply pass linearly through all sections of the application. Recommended for those who never used the application before, and want to experience everything it has to offer.  
The second button is "Hard Disk". Here you can observe how a hard disk is internally organized, with its main components named.
The third button is the "Low Level Formatting" button.  
The fourth button is the "High Level Formatting" button.  
The fifth button leads you to the "About" section, which contains text similar to this one, explaining how the application is organized and what you will find in each of the sections.  
The last button is the "Credits" button, where you can see which students developed the application, as well as the supervisioning professor.  
Lastly, on the bottom corner of the menu, the language selection flags are displayed. You can set the application language to portuguese by clicking on the Brazil flag, or set it to english by clicking on the United States flag.
